# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
1. To ensure customer satisfaction, stakeholder confidence on product and developer, proper use of allocated budget and prevent overruns and even have comply to contracts where necessary
2. proper planning and resource allocation
3. risk management - identify potential risks early

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
1. ensures optimal use of resources financial and other resources and prevent cost overruns
2. proper planning, estimation and resource allocation
3. early identification of risks

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1. Agile methodology is an iterative methodology where a software is developed in rapid cycles with incremental changes on the previous cycle while waterfall methodology is a linear methodology where software is developed in phases and phase must be completed for the next phase to begin
2. Agile pros and cons  - quick adaptability, regular customer feedback ********* less predictability, requires significant customer involvement
3. waterfall pros and cons - easy to manage due to predictability & rigidity, clear documentation and structure ********* difficult to adapt, testing occurs in the end of process


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
1. Waterfall - beneficial in projects with well defined requirements and well established structure like banking and financial systems, government and compliance systems software
   
2. Agile - projects that require flexibility, iterative development and frequent feedback. examples... custom software, AI & machine learning projects, e-commerce platforms

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. code review and walkthroughs
2. to prevent defects in the software and ensure it satify customer needs

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
1. prevent scope creep where project encounters uncontrolled changes which lead resource and budget overruns and delays.
2. improves resource allocation
3. WBS is the decomposition of project into smaller modules. it breaks down complex tasks into manageable phases which make it easier to plan, execute and track progress

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
1. help in developing detailed timeline with milestones
2. Gantt charts help in clear timeline representation, resource management, milestone tracking and progress monitoring.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
1. proper sales recording and easy inventory management
2. this issues is significant because they have been using using paper and books to keep recorded which is always at risk of wrong approximations and little statistical approach for improving sales

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
1. clearly defined problem leads to user need satisfactory software,
2. leads to enhanced efficiency in planning and development
3. leads clear definition of goals which improve collaboration and better decision making
4. Reduced or early identificaion of risks

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
1. This software is a custom software for wholesale and retail shop, that takes orders for customers, streamline orders in record sheets, streamline payment verification whether it is cash or e-money.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
1. taking handwritten order in a tab to a record in an excel sheet or record in a table
2. streamline payment verification from financial institution to records that can be further verified by the cashier

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
1. There are already set up systems that can be bought, others that don't require handwritten orders just online purchases but there are none that have a feature of converting handwritten orders to records. this ensures salespersons keep their jobs.
2. might grow within developing that are migrating slowly towards sales management software, what we call point of sale software with take order capability

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
1. Help the developer understand customer needs and develop software that improve user experience
2. Increase developet knowledge on emerging technologies
3. Help developers plan marketing, pricing and scalability strategies
4. Ensures that software complies with legal requirements and security tends
5. and also educates the developers on where to get competitive advantage
